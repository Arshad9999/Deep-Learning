## Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

The code begins by defining two activation functions: threshold() and relu(). The threshold() function returns 1 if the input is greater than 0, otherwise -1. The relu() function returns 0 if the input is less than 0, otherwise it returns the input value.

Next, a class named NeuralNetwork_for_twoinputs_oneoutput is defined. This class represents our neural network model.

The __init__() method initializes the model with the provided data and sets the initial weights and biases.

The split_data() method splits the provided data into training and testing datasets. The input features are stored in X and the target values are stored in Y.

The train_neuralnetwork() method trains the neural network using the training dataset. It takes the number of epochs as an input parameter.

Within the train_neuralnetwork() method, a loop runs for the specified number of epochs. Inside this loop, another loop iterates over each training sample.

For each training sample, the input values (x1 and x2) and the target value (t) are extracted.

The forward pass is performed by calculating the outputs of the hidden layer neurons (h1 and h2) using the current weights and biases.

The activation functions (relu()) are applied to the outputs of the hidden layer neurons (h1 and h2).

The output of the neural network (y) is calculated using the outputs of the hidden layer neurons and the current weights and biases.

The threshold() activation function is applied to the output of the neural network (y) to obtain the final predicted output (yf).

The squared error between the target value and the predicted output is calculated.

The gradients of the weights and biases with respect to the error are calculated.

The weights and biases are updated using the learning rate (0.5) and the calculated gradients.

After updating the weights and biases, another forward pass is performed to obtain the updated output and error for error tracking purposes.

The average error for each epoch is printed and stored in the train_errors list.

The test_neuralnetwork() method is used to evaluate the trained model using the testing dataset. It calculates the error for each test sample and prints the average error.

Finally, the predict() method is used to make predictions for new input values (x1 and x2). It calculates the output of the neural network and applies the threshold() function to obtain the predicted output.
