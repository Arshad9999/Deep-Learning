# OVERVIEW OF THE CODE:

The given code is an implementation of a neural network with one hidden layer using forward propagation and backpropagation. It is trained and evaluated on the Iris dataset.

The code defines a class called NeuralNetwork_for_irisdataset, which contains methods to split the data, train the neural network, test the neural network, and make predictions.

## Here is a breakdown of the code:

The class is initialized with the dataset passed as an argument, and the weights and biases for the neural network are set to initial values.

The split_data method is used to split the dataset into training and testing sets. The input features are scaled using the MinMaxScaler.

The train_neuralnetwork method is used to train the neural network. It takes the number of epochs as an argument. It iterates over each epoch and each data point in the training set, performs forward propagation to calculate the output, calculates the error using the cross-entropy loss function, and performs backpropagation to update the weights and biases using gradient descent.

The test_neuralnetwork method is used to test the trained neural network on the testing set. It calculates the output for each data point in the testing set using forward propagation and calculates the error.

The predict method is used to make predictions on new input data. It takes the input features (x1, x2, x3, x4) as arguments, scales the input using the same scaler used for training, performs forward propagation to calculate the output, and returns the predicted class label.

The code then reads the Iris dataset from a CSV file, preprocesses the data by dropping unnecessary columns and encoding the target variable into one-hot vectors.

An instance of the NeuralNetwork_for_irisdataset class is created, and the data is split into training and testing sets.

The neural network is trained for a specified number of epochs using the train_neuralnetwork method.

The trained neural network is tested on the testing set using the test_neuralnetwork method.

Finally, a prediction is made on new input data (5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2) using the predict method, and the predicted class label is printed.
