<b>Here's a breakdown of the code:-</b>

<b>threshold function:</b> This function applies the threshold activation function, returning 1 if the input is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.

<b>relu function:</b> This function applies the ReLU activation function, returning 0 if the input is negative, and the input itself otherwise.

<b>NeuralNetwork_for_twoinputs_oneoutput class:</b> This class represents the neural network for the XOR function. It initializes the class variables, such as weights, biases, and errors, and defines methods for splitting the data, training the neural network, testing the neural network, and making predictions.

<b>split_data method:</b> This method splits the input data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from the sklearn library.

<b>train_neuralnetwork method:</b> This method trains the neural network for a specified number of epochs. It iterates over the training data, calculates the forward and backward passes for each data point, updates the weights and biases based on the error, and stores the average error for each epoch.

<b>test_neuralnetwork method:</b> This method tests the trained neural network on the testing data. It calculates the error for each data point and stores the errors.

<b>predict method:</b> This method takes input values and predicts the output using the trained neural network.

<b>data_xor_gate DataFrame:</b> This DataFrame represents the XOR function truth table, with input features 'x1' and 'x2' and the target output 't'.

Creating an instance of the NeuralNetwork_for_twoinputs_oneoutput class, model1, and calling the necessary methods to split the data, train the neural network, test the neural network, and make a prediction.
