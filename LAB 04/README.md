# OVERVIEW OF THE CODE

The given code is an implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using the backpropagation algorithm. The objective of the code is to build a neural network with one hidden layer, consisting of two neurons, one input layer with four neurons, and one output layer with three neurons. The activation function used in the hidden layer is the sigmoid function, and the activation function used in the output layer is the softmax function. The iris dataset is used to train and evaluate the neural network.

The code begins by defining a class called "NeuralNetwork_for_irisdataset" and initializing it with the iris dataset. The weights and biases for the neural network are also initialized in the constructor.

The "split_data" method is used to preprocess the data by splitting it into input features (X) and target labels (Y). The input features are then scaled using the MinMaxScaler. The data is further divided into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from sklearn.

The "train_neuralnetwork" method trains the neural network using the backpropagation algorithm. It takes the number of epochs as input and iterates over the training data for the specified number of epochs. Within each epoch, it calculates the forward pass of the network, computes the error using the cross-entropy loss function, and updates the weights and biases using gradient descent. The average error for each epoch is printed.

The "test_neuralnetwork" method tests the trained neural network using the testing data. It performs a forward pass for each input in the testing data, calculates the error, and prints the error for each input. It also calculates the average error for all the test inputs.

The "predict" method takes input features (x1, x2, x3, x4) and performs a forward pass through the network to predict the output. The softmax function is used to obtain the probabilities for each class, and the predicted class label is printed.

## CONCLUSION:
Finally, the iris dataset is loaded from a CSV file, preprocessed by replacing the species labels with one-hot encoded vectors, and shuffled. An instance of the "NeuralNetwork_for_irisdataset" class is created, and the data is split. The neural network is trained for 8 epochs, tested using the test data, and a prediction is made for a sample input (5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2).
